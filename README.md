## About The Project

This project entailed building a hotel management tool for hotel customers and staff to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. A large focus was placed upon using Object Oriented Programming to drive design and functionality and utilizing asynchronous javascript with an API. In addtion, a robust test suite was created to thoroughly tests all functionality of this client-side application.

The application was also tested for cross-browser compatiability and responsive design for all screen sizes. Sass was utilized to DRY up the CSS file and use dynamic styling. The project also focused upon accessibility and was tested for 100% accessible features.

## Set-up Instructions

1. Clone this [Github repository](https://github.com/elizhahn/overlook) to your local machine using the `git clone` command in your Terminal.
2. Clone this [Github repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
3. Move into each directory and run `npm install` and then `npm start` in two different terminals
4. visit http://localhost:8080/ to see the application live

## Learning Goals
- OOP design
- applying Sass to DRY up the CSS
- Utilizing fetch calls and the API to strengthen understanding of asynchronous javascript
- Solidify the code review process
- More practice and application of TDD and it's importance


## Challenges

1. Planning: intentionally planning an overall strategy before writing code. This included class structures and methods, and their respective tests, creating a wireframe for all the layouts, and implementing a detailed `gitHub` project board.
2. Utilizing an API and managing data flow with fetch calls. 
3. Error handling for API calls and UX



## Wins

1. The minimum viable product (MVP) was achieved and most of the manager dashboard is completed. 
2. The testing suite is specific with happy/sad path outcomes 
3. Creating a user interface that is easy to use and displays information on multiple screens.

## Future Iterations

1. Allow a manager to delete a booking for a user
2. Create a responsive design for the manager dashboard and additional styling for UX
3. Allow user's to click on a room picture and see more details about the room
